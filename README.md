# iris-flower-classification
This is a k-nearest neighbors classification algorithm for flower measurements of irises.

Data obtained from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

Completed: Algorithm, run me. By running run.py, the classifier will classify the test data set, output the predictions and the model's accuracy.

To Do: run script through Docker, have it write to a file for user to copy out

Ideas: Add more algorithms to classify the same data set and analyze speed and accuracy for each.
